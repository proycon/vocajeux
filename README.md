Vocajeux
==========

A modular and high-performance vocabulary learning toolset. At its core it
provides a Rust library which can be used to build all kinds of vocabulary
games and trainers. Includes are several tools you can use of the box.

This project is currently developed as a toy project for me to learn Rust.

The following tools are provided:

* ``vj`` - The standalone terminal-based vocajeux tool. It offers various quiz types and flashcard ability.
* ``vjd`` - The vocajeux daemon, provides a webservice that servers vocabulary lists and maintains scores.
* ``vjc`` - The vocajeux client, communicates with the daemon.

Future
-------

* Webinterface communicating with vjd
* Python binding
